    <p id = 'main'> Hello! My name is April Zhao and I am studying Data Science and Biology at Northeastern University. Welcome to my personal website where I share my various interests and experiences. </p><br>
    
    <p id = 'main'>In terms of academic interests, I have a strong interest in the fields of bioinformatics, genomic,  and computational biology. I am passionate about leveraging data-driven approaches to advance biotechnology and genetic medicine, contributing to innovations that improve patient care and treatments. I am pursuing an independent research project in the Monaghan lab, where I analyze sequencing data to understand limb regeneration mechanisms in axolotl salamanders. Currently, I am looking for potential co-op positions related to this area, and am open to learning new technologies and lab techniques in an industry setting. I am thinking about pursuing graduate study that will allow me to continue to explore the intersection between data science and the life sciences, expanding my knowledge in this area. </p><br>

    <p id = 'main'> Outside of academics, I enjoy trying new drinks and desserts. My personal favorites are mango sago and boba tea which is why those images are being displayed. I also enjoy traveling to various places around the world, and spent my first year of my undergraduate degree abroad in London, which allowed me to explore nearby European countries. I am always open for future travel opportunities, both local and international!</p><br>
